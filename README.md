# QB64 MOD Player

A ProTracker (and compatible) MOD player written in QB64

Goals:
    No dependency on 3rd party libraries
    Support all MOD types (1 - 99 channels, 31 samples etc.) - WIP
    No mixing code - depend on QB64 internal sound engine mixer [FAIL - No _NEWSOUND in QB64]
    Easy plug-n-play API - WIP
