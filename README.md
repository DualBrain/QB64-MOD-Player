## FAQ

Why a MOD player in QB64?

Just for learning and fun!

Will you add S3M, XM, IT support?

No. But you are free to fork and do it yourself.

I found a bug. How can I help?

There are probably many bugs now. This will change as the code matures. In the meantime, let me know using GitHub issues.

Can this be used in a game / demo?

Absolutely. With little effort. But I have not tried integrating this into anything myself (yet).
