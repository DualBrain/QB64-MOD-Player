[5] Samples

Samples are of crucial importance in mods. Good samples make the difference
between a quite-good and a great mod. And since custom samples are one of
mods' greatest advantages, a lot of attention should be paid to a wise choice
in samples.

It is important to know the main two qualities a sample has, the resolution,
i.e. number of bits, and its sampling rate. The number of bits in a sample
denote its ability to distinguish between levels of amplitude, a higher number
of bits can grasp a sound more accurately than a low one. The sampling rate is
directly related to the highest frequency that can be reproduced by the
sample. A sample with a sampling rate of 40kHz, for example (kHz means 1000Hz,
1Hz is one oscillation per second), can reproduce sounds of up to 20kHz. This
means that low sampling rates can be used to reproduce low sounds, but
reproduction of high frequencies (cymbals, but also pianos) require higher
sampling rates. The theory behind this is known as the Nyquist theorem.

Another aspect of mods is the maximum size a sample is allowed to have. This
varies in the file formats from 64 Kilobytes to virtually unlimited size. Note
that some trackers impose harsher limits on sample length than the formats
they output. The solution offered to the sample size problem is sample
looping. Well placed loop points make quite a difference in sustained
instruments, so spend enough time here.

Sample formats seem to be a very confusing subject in the mod community.
Especially SAM and SMP don't seem to be at all well understood. Keep in mind
that filename extensions can be arbitrarily chosen and changed in most
operating systems, so they lose any identifier quality. Thus I consider sample
formats those files which can be identified by some sort of header. SAM and
SMP, when meaning MOD (i.e. M.K., xCHN, FLTx, NST, etc.) samples, do not have
any header. They are simply data assembled in a file. A tracker using them
decodes them to 8-bit raw signed sample data. But it assumes a playback rate
to be used. Normally, finetune and loop values can not be stored in MOD
samples (Fasttracker 1 circumvents this problem by abusing the file's date and
time stamp). The only safe method to exchange MOD samples is to use these in
MOD files and exchange these (if there are other safe ways on the Amiga or
another platform, please correct me). See section 5.1.3 on how to convert to
"SAM format".

[5.1.1] Sampling

This section supplied by Andy Church <achurch@goober.mbhs.edu>.

Although the specific methods used for sampling vary from platform to platform
and program to program, the general procedure is the same. The first thing you
need to do is connect your sound source, such as an electronic keyboard, to
the input of your sampler. Then you should start up your sampling program (if
you haven't done so already). Many programs have a "monitoring mode" where you
can listen to what you will be recording before you actually record. If
possible, take advantage of this so that you can adjust the sampler's input
level and your sound source's volume before sampling to avoid problems with
volume (see below).

When you have adjusted the volume, or if you do not have a monitoring mode,
you can actually sample the sound. Usually this just involves clicking on a
"Start" button, playing the sound on the sound source, and clicking on "Stop".
Then you will probably be taken to an editor screen where you can see what you
have recorded. You may discover one of two problems with your sample at this
point (especially if you couldn't monitor the signal ahead of time):

  - If the overall volume is too low, you lose resolution and clarity in the
    sample. Generally, if the maximum amplitude of your sample (on a typical
    waveform display, represented by vertical distance from a central axis) is
    less than three-quarters of the total window height, your sample is too
    soft. For sounds that you want to be soft, you can adjust the volume later
    inside the module.

  - If the volume is too high, you get "clipping" when the input sound exceeds
    the limits of the sampler. If you see flat lines at the top and/or bottom
    of your sample display, or if you hear a lot of distortion, your sample is
    being clipped; you should reduce the volume or the sampler's input level
    and sample again.

Once you have successfully sampled a sound, what you do next depends on what
kind of sound you have sampled. If it is a "one-shot" sound - a sound that
only plays once and does not repeat, such as a drum - you are done, and you
can save the sample to disk, ready to be loaded into your module. However, if
the sample is a continuous or repeating sound, like a flute, you will need to
determine where to place the looping section of the sample.

Determining the loop start and end points is usually a matter of careful
listening and a lot of trial and error. Sometimes you will be able to look at
the sample or a part of it and determine what part of the sample is repeating;
often, however, you will just have to make a guess and play with the begin and
end points until the sample sounds good. One thing to note when adjusting the
loop points: since the sample right before the end point is immediately
followed by the sample at the start point, those two samples should be very
close if not equal in amplitude. Usually, this can be done by looking for
"zero points" - places where the sample's waveform crosses the zero-axis - but
any value will do. If the two samples are very different in amplitude, the
result will be an audible "click" when the sample reaches the end of the loop.
This is one easy way to tell whether your loop points are well-placed or not:
if you hear a click while the sample is playing back which was not in the
original sound, you need to move your loop points.

[5.1.2] 'Ripping'

Using samples made by other people and acquired by saving out of their mods is
generally known as ripping. I won't debate on the ethical aspects of this
subject and I suggest nobody does. It has been discussed before.

Just about any tracker enables you to save the samples in a mod. So all you've
got to do is load the song you want a sample from into a compatible tracker
and save it. There are other programs that enable you to rip samples from mods
too, one of them being DMPC, Dual Module Player Companion by Brad Meier of
Psychic Software, a mod player shell for MS-DOS. While most trackers save
samples in their own proprietary format or as raw MOD-compatible samples, DMPC
saves to WAV/VOC/RAW.

  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/frontend/dmpc260.zip

If you don't have a tracker or a ripper, you can still obtain the samples in
mods by loading the file into a sample editor capable of loading raw sample
data. You will have to set the number of bits and style (signed or unsigned)
according to the format you're loading (MOD is signed 8 bit, S3M is unsigned 8
bit, for example). You will be presented with some static, which is the header
and pattern data, followed by the samples in the mod. Any decent sample editor
should enable you to cut out the individual samples. The next step would be to
get the sampling rate right, otherwise the samples will sound off key when
used. MOD samples generally use a sampling rate of 8363Hz for a C in the
second octave, so try this for starters (or an integer multiple). The more
advanced formats with variable CxSpds pose more of a problem, you're basically
left with your ears and perhaps a musical instrument to get them right. Note
that a lot of MOD samples are not tuned to C. Quite often, an A is played
instead when a C should be. See appendix H for a table of note frequencies to
help you calculate the appropriate sampling rate for transposing wrongly tuned
instruments.

[5.1.3] Conversion From Other Formats

Sample conversion is covered in detail in the Patch Reference and the Audio
File Format FAQ (see section 5 on their obtainability).

The most general sample file converter is probably SOX, SOund eXchange
utility. It is available on most FTP servers as C source code and will run on
almost any platform. An MS-DOS compiled version exists under the name
SOX7DOS.ZIP. Note that version 10 is also available, but seems to contain some
bugs. See the audio file format FAQ for details.

Another MS-DOS utility is CONVERT, it features a wide range of input and
output formats. An interesting quality for this FAQ is its ability to extract
samples from mods of various formats. Conversion of samples to mod formats is
a bit lacking, though, but this is due to the rather large differences in the
formats concerned (GUS patches don't convert at all well, for example).

  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/converters/convert13.zip

Generally, most trackers read at least some form of raw sample data. If they
output to some form of MOD format, they most probably read 8-bit signed data,
while some PC trackers (most notably ST3) prefer unsigned samples. The more
modern trackers which read 16-bit samples will most probably read some
standard headered sample format, which makes conversion (with SOX, for
example) pretty easy, so I won't elaborate on it. See your sample editor's or
converter's documentation.

To convert a sample from one filetype so that you can use it in a tracker for
which only raw 8-bit data is suitable, you need:
- an input file (yeah, why else would you be reading this, but you do need it)
- a sample converter or editor that can write raw 8-bit data.
- if this program can't read your input file you need another program to
  convert it to an interchangeable format type, such as WAV, IFF/S8VX or VOC,
  which are readable by most converters and editors.

Go about it this way:
If necessary, convert the input file to the interchange format, leaving its
attributes untouched, if possible (which are the number of bits, channels and
sampling rate).
Now check to see if the sample will be suitable for the tracker. The main
things to look for are sample size in converted state and the sampling rate.
A lot of formats still impose limits on the sample size they are willing to
deal with. Let's assume you have a limit of 64 KB, i.e. 65536 bytes. And that
the tracker (or rather the format) uses 8-bit sample data. Assuming further
that you have an input file that is a 16-bit stereo sample, you must divide
that sample's size by four to estimate its size when converted so that it
suits your tracker ('s format). Four because you divide by two when converting
16 to 8 bits, and by two again because your tracker can only use mono samples
(sorry for having forgotten about this before). If the resulting approximate
filesize (which is approximate because you haven't accounted for the file
header in the calculation) is larger than your limit, write down your result
and look at the sampling rate of the input file and the note that it plays at
that sampling rate.
It could well be that your tracker ('s format) uses a fixed sampling rate to
reproduce a C in a certain octave and calculates the sampling rates to use for
other notes with reference to this "master C playback sampling rate" (also
known as CxSpd). So, if you have a sample with a different sampling rate than
this CxSpd, the sample will sound off tune. Remember that the C is THE
reference point in the tracker. This is getting too complicated, so I'll give
an example.
Say I want to convert this great Kurzweil 2000 patch for use in a M.K.
tracker, in my case FastTracker 1 (as it imposes even harsher limits than PT).
I know that FT1 only uses up to 64KB of a sample and that it uses raw 8-bit
signed mono data. I also know that M.K.'s root C is the C-2 and that the
playback sampling rate used for that note is 8287Hz for PAL Amiga systems (and
I'm in Europe and NTSC Amigas are far too rare for me to care about). That's
all I need to know about the target.

I know that my source KRZ file is a multi-sample with five 16-bit signed mono
samples in it. I use 2PAT (which has been renamed to AWAVE) or another program
to tell me the KRZ file's information, which gives me the number of individual
samples in the file, their note range, playback sampling rate and the note
this rate represents.

I then use 2PAT to extract the individual samples to WAV files (actually I
already did that and looked up the information in the description file that
was generated simultaneously). I like the third of the five samples and want
to convert this one. The description reveals that it is 16-bit, mono and plays
an A at a sampling rate of 32kHz. I want to tune my sample to C, so I look up
appendix I in the MOD-FAQ and find that an A is associated to 440Hz and a C to
261.7Hz. From this I gather that I have to play the sample at ( 32000 * 261.7
/ 440 = 19033 )Hz so it sounds like a C. So that's the first thing I do, I
change the sample's playback rate to 19033Hz (NOTE: only changing the SPEED of
the sample, no resampling involved).

In my specific case, the sample I'm converting is not well suited to be played
at more than one octave (this is the case with a lot of real-instrument
samples). So I allow myself to use only the top M.K. octave (from C-3 to B-3)
and resample from 19033Hz to 16574Hz (2 * 8287Hz), which represents a C-3 in
M.K.. I do this while still in the 16 bit domain because of the larger
precision (aliasing faults are less severe and interpolation is more exact).

Then I convert the sample from 16-bit to 8-bit. If the input sample was pretty
quiet, I'd probably maximize its volume first, thereby taking advantage of the
16 bits of resolution and reducing rounding errors.

If my sample is now still larger than 64KB, I have four choices. I can
resample the sample to 8287Hz (no aliasing errors induced, as this is
downsampling by an integer) and halve the sample's size at the cost of losing
high frequencies. I can also resample to a different note somewhere in between
the C-2 and C-3, at the cost of having to transpose the instrument in the M.K.
later (i.e. pitch shifting, as the note shown by the tracker isn't correct).
My third choice is to crop the sample and find a good loop. My final choice is
to apply a volume envelope to the sample and have it fade out fast enough to
fit into the limit. Which method I choose depends on the sound I am
converting. Quite often a combination of several processes will yield the best
results.

When I've finished the sample editing process, I either save it in an
interchange format (if the editor doesn't support output in raw signed 8-bit
mono data) which my converter understands, or I write the sample data to disk
in raw signed 8-bit mono style. In the first case, I ask my converter to
perform the just described conversion. Assuming I have written a WAV file and
want to convert it to FT1-usable, I'd use SOX in the following manner:
sox -V infile.WAV -ts8 outfile.SMP     <- issued on the command line
I could then load outfile.SMP into FastTracker 1.

Hope this helps.

Sound Samplers/Editors for the Mac aren't too easy to find.. but the best
Sound Editor for the Mac is "Macromind SoundEdit" (Versions include:
SoundEdit, SoundEdit Pro, SoundEdit 16" etc..) This has to be one of the best
sound recorders and editors for mac.. it has most if not all the options from
all the other programs listed for other platforms and it can do more stuff..
It has tons of effects and other options: reverb, bending, speed, pitch,
flanger, noise, equalizer, mixer, backwards, tone generator, FM Synthesis,
precision mapping, spectrum/waveform/dots, up to 44kHz sampling rate 8/16 (and
even 24 methinks) bit recording, notes/tags on specific sections of samples,
variety of formats AIFF, System 7 Sound, Resources, WAVS, Instrument, au,

[6] Obtaining Mods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6.1] FTP Servers

General: The FTP servers mentioned hereafter allow for anonymous FTP. Log into
the server by specifying 'ftp <server address>', tell it 'ftp' when it asks
you for a login and supply it with your email address as a password.
Alternatively, use 'anonymous' as login and your email address as password.
Please remember that ftp is a privilege, not a right. Restrict your calls to
(the site's) non-business hours whenever possible.

The largest repository of mods is probably the Aminet. There are numerous FTP
servers all over the world mirroring it. A list follows:

>These are the members of Aminet and have the files from here.  All mirrors
>have the new files but most delete old files, however ftp.wustl.edu and
>ftp.cdrom.se keep all files.  Whenever possible, use the mirror that is the
>closest to your place.  Most mirrors get updated three times a day.

Another good site for new mod releases is ftp.cdrom.com (Hornet/Wasp, formerly
based at ftp.eng.ufl), the main Internet site for PC demos and related
material. Mods can be found in the /pub/demos/music/songs directory, sorted by
format type. Note that due to diskspace limitations, mods usually don't stay
on this site for longer than a month. Hornet is mirrored by ftp.uwp.edu
(131.210.1.4) USA, ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2) Sweden, ftp.sun.ac.za
(146.232.212.21) S.Africa, ftp.uni-erlangen.de (131.188.2.43) Germany,
ftp.uni-paderborn.de (131.234.10.42) Germany and ftp.cdrom.com
(192.216.191.11) USA. Hornet also publishes DemoNews on a weekly basis, it
includes demo-related news and a list of uploads and deletions. To subscribe,
send email to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za with "subscribe demuan-list
YOUR_NAME" (w/o quotes) in the body of the message, substituting YOUR_NAME
with, guess, yeah, your name. You will then receive DemoNews weekly, it is
sent out each Sunday morning.

The GUS FTP sites also have a number of mods in their directories. Mods can be
found in the subdirectories 'sound/*'. The sites are:

[6.3] Newsgroups

Naturally, alt.binaries.sounds.mods is THE Usenet newsgroup for mods. Binary
posts to this group are usually split into several parts and uuencoded. If
that doesn't make sense to you, that doesn't matter. Just read on. Here's how
to extract the mods from the text garbage.

How you do it exactly is up to you and the newsreader you're using. I will
cover NN, RN and TIN here, as well as telling you how to cope with dumb
uudecoders. Thanks to Stan Greene (Merlin) <sorcerer@netcom.com> for supplying
the information initially.

NN: Let's assume you have a list of five articles on screen, identified by
    consecutive letters a through e, of which the last four are the file
    example.mod. First, tag (i.e. mark) the parts by pressing the appropriate
    letters (b through e). Then type the following: ':decode'. Choose any
    directory you wish when prompted for the Decode Directory, this is where
    the decoded file will go. At the next prompt (Decode test2/ Article
    (* +):, for example), enter '*' to specify the previously selected
    articles. NN will then decode the files for you.

RN/TRN: Assuming that the file is in multiple parts, go to the first part and
    press 'e'. Continue going through all of the parts, pressing 'e' for each.
    As you do each part, you should see 'Continuing filename.ext:
    (Continued)'. When you get to the last part and press 'e', you're done. It
    knows that the file is complete.

TIN: We will assume the same setting as in the NN example. The first thing you
    do is move the scrollbar to the first part of the file you want, this'd be
    the 2nd article in the list. Now press 't' to tag the file, the plus sign
    in front of the article should turn into a '1' and the scrollbar should
    move to the next line. Tag all the parts of the file in the same manner,
    watching out so you keep the order correct. When you're done, press 's',
    which gives you the following prompt: 'Save a)rticle, t)hread, h)ot,
    p)attern, T)agged articles, q)uit: T'. The default should be a captial T,
    which is what youy want anyway, so just hit return. TIN will prompt you
    for a filename, you can use anything, basically, keeping it simple should
    prove helpful (to you). Done that, TIN asks you for post-processing
    options. Most of the time, you will want to uudecode the binaries, so
    press 'u'. Done.

BY HAND: OK, there are two possibilities here. Either you have a smart
    uudecoder (such as UU, UNPOST or UUMASTER for MS-DOS, or WinCode for
    Windows), or you're stuck with a basic dumb type.
    - SMART: This is pretty simple. Just save your articles to a common file
      and feed it to your smart decoder. Using UU, this'd look like this,
      after having saved some articled to a file called mods.uue:
      'uu /i /s mods.uue'. UU will do the rest. Note that it is good to have
      several smart decoders at hand in case one of them refuses to decode a
      file. You can then always try the others.
    - DUMB: This is tedious. Save the articles, preferrably and for your own
      sanity's sake, to separate files, using some form of numbering scheme so
      you'll know which part is which later on. Then call your favourite text
      editor (as in ASCII) and trim out anything from the files that isn't a
      valid UU line. This includes everything up to, but not including, the
      line saying 'begin 640 blabla.mod', which should be in the first part,
      and everything after the line saying 'end', which should be in the last
      part. You also need to trim out any checksum info, mail/posting headers
      and signatures (these should be at the end of the files). When you've
      done all that, concatenate (i.e. join) the files, but keep them in the
      correct order! Feed the resulting file to your dumb decoder.

[6.4] WWW

Zigg (Matt Behrens) <behrensm@river.it.gvsu.edu> told me on 5 Dec 1994:
Here's a little-known fact concerning the Web (one that I've picked up on and
sprinkled liberally throughout the links to Aminet): Aminet is available in a
few spots via HTTP.  The home site, being ftp.wustl.edu, of course, is
accessible at
  http://ftp.wustl.edu/~aminet/index.html.
All aminet files are accessible through wuarchive's http system (eliminating
the need to wait "for usage to go down") at
  http://ftp.wustl.edu/systems/amiga/aminet/*.
Extending this information on 5 May 95, Zigg tells us that another way to
Aminet via HTTP is by accessing freedom.wit.com at:
  http://freedom.wit.com/mirrors/amiga/...

Zigg has also set up the Virtual Music Page, which you'll find at:
  http://www2.gvsu.edu/~behrensm/vmp/index.html.

Dan (Maelcum/KFMF) <dan@bepcp.bowker.com> wrote to the KLF-List on 2 Feb 95:
The KFMF WWW site will soon be:
  http://kosmic.wit.com/~kosmic/
It might (still) be:
  http://freedom.wit.com/~klf/klfhome.html
and/or
  http://ftp.luth.se/pub/misc2/kosmic/www/

And Jason M. Spangler <jasons@cis.ysu.edu> tells us on 31 Oct 1994:
Just thought I'd tell everyone I updated, re-organized, and moved my
module FTP site page... it's now at:
  http://www.ysu.edu/~jasons/mod/index.html

Tim Gerchmez <future@eskimo.com> posted to a.b.s.mods on 28 Apr 95:
Check out my MOD page on the Worldwide Web. As far as I know, it's now the
best and most comprehensive source of info on MODs (jester's note: Ahem! ;) )
and related topics on the Web. It can be accessed via a graphical browser
(recommended) and is also Lynx-friendly.

[7] Distributing Mods

When you're sick of listening to other people's creations, have mastered a
tracker and finally come up with something you consider brilliant or at least
good enough for other people to enjoy, you want to spread it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[7.0.1] Compression

Thanks to Rich La Bonte <flatrich@aol.com> for suggestions concerning this
section.

It is always a good idea to compress a module before you distribute it.
Especially when using telecommunications systems (i.e. telephone lines or
networks), data compression can reduce a lot of transmission time and
bandwidth. The two main archivers used in compressing mods are LHA/LHarc and
PKZIP. LHA is used mainly on Amigas, but compatible archivers/dearchivers
exist on just about any platform. The same goes for the MS-DOS originated
PKZIP. Other archivers may perform better compression, but aren't a good
choice if you want your file to be decodable by as many people as possible.

Note though that even though LHA/LHarc's archiving is generally compatible
across platforms, users should be aware of the limitations of other systems.
While flipped orders of filename and extension is rather easy to fix and is
not a problem (by which I want to express that I discourage discussions about
efficiencies and deficiencies of the various platforms), there are several
incompatibilities which hinder distribution.

LHA/LHarc for Amiga can store attributes that prevent MS-DOS LHA from
dearchiving the files contained. A filename beginning with a period has the
same effect, as MS-DOS uses the period to symbolize the current directory
only. Mac files include a header containing a resource and a data fork. The
resource fork is absolutely Mac-specific and is incompatible with any other
system (AFAIK).

Please prove netiquette - compress your mods with LHA, PKZIP or compatible
compressors and use a method which will enable your recipients to dearchive
them.

See appendix H for a list of sites for these programs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7.1] Usenet Posting (to a.b.s.mods)

This being the FAQ for the group, it is natural that postings to it should
find a place here. Usenet poses some difficulties concerning the transmission
of binary data, as mods are. Only 7-bit ASCII is transmitted, while binaries
are 8-bit files. This means that mods need to be encoded before they can be
posted to Usenet. There are several encoding methods, the most common being
uuencoding. Others include MIME, XX and a few others, but these are not
recommended (you want as many people as possible to hear your creations, don't
you?). Don't even attempt to post a binary to usenet without having encoded it
to ASCII.

Use of encoding methods other than uuencoding is strongly discouraged.
Uuencoding is the de-facto Usenet standard and tools exist to deal with it on
virtually all platforms, while other standards, while perhaps being better in
some respects, are bound to cause problems for a lot of users.

Another problem is that some news servers don't read more than a certain
amount of lines in usenet postings. This is why most posts are split into
'small' chunks. A maximum of 1000 lines seems sensible (this is roughly
64 KBytes).

It is considered good netiquette and STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to supply a part
zero of howevermany including a description of the posted file. I hereby
declare the following as the FAQ-standard part zero for a.b.s.mods:

- example cut here - - - - - - - - - - -
FILE NAME: example.mod
SONG NAME: The exemplary Song
ARCHIVE: PkZip 2.04g
MOD TYPE: 8CHN
COMPOSER: Nobody
METHOD: Original
MUSICAL STYLE: ambient deep techno house
POSTER: Nobody too <nobody@nothing.not>
UPLOADED TO: ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/incoming/example.zip
COMMENTS: This is just an example

Explanation of the above:
- FILE NAME: This is pretty clear. I suggest the original mod's extension be
  stated, as the archiver is stated further down.
- SONG NAME: The name given to the song in the mod's songname field. Or the
  full name of the song if that field didn't suffice (example: "I'm gonna be
  infectious" by Romeo Knight)
- ARCHIVE: The name of the archiver used. Only LHA/Lharc and PkZip and
  compatible programs are encouraged. It is important to specify the version
  number here.
- MOD TYPE: The exact mod type. MOD is not exact! See section 2 for a list of
  exact mod type definitions.
- COMPOSER: The person who made the mod, if known.
- METHOD: The method with which the mod was made. There are four categories
  here, Original, Conversion, Transcribed and Sampled.
  + An Original is any original composition, music that originated in a mod
    type. Pieces originated in one mod type and then transferred to another
    also qualify for this term.
  + A Conversion is a composition that has been converted from another type of
    music format (e.g. MIDI, ROL, CMF) to a mod type format. Slight re-edits
    of the mod file are still to be considered Conversions.
  + A Transcribed mod is a transcription of music that originated in a
    non-computer form, such as sheet music or as music on CDs and/or
    cassettes.
  + Sampled mods are pieces of music strung together in a mod format by
    sampling parts of a song (usually from CD or cassette) and playing them at
    a constant speed.
- MUSICAL STYLE: A rough approximation of the style the song is in. No attempt
  should be made to try to fill this entry out exactly, as it just isn't
  absolutely possible. However, an estimation of the style should be supplied,
  as this is possible in most cases.
- POSTER: This is you. Your name and/or handle and/or email address should go
  here.
- UPLOADED TO: Where else the mod is available, per ftp for example.
- COMMENTS: Write anything you feel should be said about your posting and/or
  its contents here.

Use subject lines that include the filename of your posting and the part
number, the latter either in brackets (recommended) or in the form "part x of
y".

If you feel like it, put a very short description in the subject line.
However, if you follow this guideline, a subject line saying simply
"EXAMPLE.abc (x/y)" should suffice.

The above example would have the following subjects, assuming that the
uuencoded data took four parts:
Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (0/4)
Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (1/4)
Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (2/4)
Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (3/4)
Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (4/4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7.2] FTP Uploads

Most of the ftp servers you can download mods from will accept uploads too.
These usually go in an /incoming directory somewhere. Be sure to upload a text
file with a short description (similar to part zero in section 7.1) along with
the mod. Also remember to specify 'bin' for binary transfer, or your mod might
be transmitted as a 7-bit file, thereby completely corrupting it. Making an
announcement in a.b.s.mods about your upload will most probably be welcome.
See section 6.1 for a list of ftp servers with mods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7.3] BBS Uploads

I don't know anything about this (except some BBS names). But if you managed
to download something from a BBS, you probably know how to upload something
too.

Appendix B: Common Properties of Module File Formats

They're all chunks of bytes. Heh heh. ;) OK, seriously now.

All mod files contain a header identifying the file and its format. It also
mentions song name and number of patterns in the song. The header is usually
followed by the pattern and sequencing information. Finally, the file also
contains the sample data. This usually takes up most of the space in a mod.
With today's file formats advancing more and more, those are just about all
the common properties worth mentioning, IMHO. For further information on
particular mod types, refer to the format description. This is usually found
in the same archive as the tracker it is connected to. You can also check

  ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/text

for some docs. Following format specs are available there:

MOD - modform.zip     FTK - musfmt10.zip    SSS - musfmt10.zip
PSM - psm-form.zip    MED - musfmt10.zip    STAR- musfmt10.zip

Appendix C: Mods and MIDI

Here is a good posting made by Jens Puchert on the subject, slightly edited by
myself to retain the FAQ's terminology. Supplied to me by Harald Zappe.

In article <CtsoDr.G86@dorsai.org> oneshot@dorsai.org (jason_wong) writes:

This discussion seems to be older than "What was there first, the chicken
or the egg?"  Anyway, we can't answer either of those important 
philosophical questions to the full satisfaction of everybody.  You should 
realize that mod and MIDI are inherently different things that cannot be
compared easily with each other (a famous phrase about two fist-sized
fruits comes to mind).  The major difference is that digital music 
modules (also popularly known as mods) contain sampled instruments while
MIDI files don't contain any instruments at all and rather rely on your
sound hardware to synthesize them (by various means of course).  So that
yields another big difference.  Modules are hardware independent, they
(should) sound the same on just about every piece of hardware (excluding
cases in which the player screws up and doesn't do what it's supposed to,
cases where playback is attempted on totally inappropriate devices such
as the PC squeaker, and cases where playback is attempted on devices that
don't provide sufficient quality such as a mono Sound Blaster).  On the
other hand, MIDI devices are free to generate instruments to their 
liking, some of those will sound better (Roland Sound Canvas) and others
will sound unbearable (AdLib comes to mind).  Both devices however are
perfectly fine MIDI compliant.  Also, those MIDI instruments are
standardized into a set called General MIDI.  With most MIDI devices 
you'll be limited to use the 128 pre-defined instruments from this GM
set.  A plus for MIDI is the availability of very professional,
sophisticated composition tools that are not available in this variety
and quality to create modules.  As far as remixes, cover versions, and
original creations concerns, all of them can be done and found in either
the MIDI or the module format, so there's no inherent connection between
format and musical style and origin.

So to sum this up, if sophisticated composing software and professional
quality is important to you go for MIDI, if device independance and
therefore easy exchangability, custom instruments and voices, and lower
cost are important to you then you should go for modules.

Hope this helps...

Appendix F: the MOD Charts

The MOD Charts are a Top 100 list of mods, maintained by Oliver
(oliver@math.uni-muenster.de, a.k.a. HITMAN on IRC, #modcharts). Multitrack
formats have recently been allowed into the charts. For further details,
connect to your nearest supporting site (see list below) and download the
informational files. I am aware of this list being from last year, I don't
plan to update it every time it is released anew. If you notice incorrect
information, tell me (jester) about it and I'll grab the newest info and

Appendix H: Table of Note Frequencies

Use this to calculate sampling rates for mistuned instruments. For example, if
you have an instrument at 8363Hz that plays an A-2 but you want it to play a
C-2, the appropriate sampling rate is 8363 * 261.7 / 440 Hz = 4974 Hz
All values are given in Hz.

(supplied by Chris Craig, author of GoldWave)

C  - 261.7    E  - 329.6    G# - 415.3
C# - 277.2    F  - 349.2    A  - 440.0
D  - 293.7    F# - 370.0    A# - 466.2
D# - 311.1    G  - 392.0    B  - 493.9

Bear in mind that doubling the sampling rate raises a sound by one octave,
halving the rate lowers the note by one octave.

Appendix I: Overview of Effects Used in Digital Music Modules

This section supplied by Jens Puchert.

The following covers all ProTracker and ScreamTracker 3 effects.  The 
effect commands are given for ProTracker first, and then for Scream
Tracker.  Fast-, Take-, and MultiTracker also use the ProTracker
command set.  The parameters are given as "x", "xx", or "xy".  "x"
means there's a single parater for this effect.  "xx" means there's
a single parameter composed of two digits.  "xy" means there are
two independent parameters for this effect.

Appendix J: Answers to as yet Unanswered FAQs

This section is still under construction and will probably always stay that
way. FAQs that don't quite fit into any other section will be assembled here.
Because of this, this appendix will appear very unsorted and messy.
Suggestions for additions, corrections or deletions are welcome.

1) How is MOD played back correctly

   One would think that MOD is a standard format. Unfortunately, it isn't
   anymore. While the only real reference for this format remains the Amiga's
   ProTracker, even in the early stages of MOD, incompatibilities came around
   through the different timing methods in PAL and NTSC Amigas.
   The advent of all sorts of trackers writing in MOD formats, by which I mean
   all formats complying to PT's way of storing header, pattern info (not
   restricted to 4-track though), sequencing list and sample data, have
   brought about more complications since a lot of their players prove to be
   PT-incompatible.
   The problem is that the composer of a MOD relies on his song's sound using
   his tracker (even though some tailor theirs for certain players), so,
   assuming tracker XX is not PT-compliant in its player, a song made in
   tracker XX will not sound the way its composer wanted it to when played in
   ProTracker, which is accepted as THE standard for MODs.
   As it is, ProTracker remains the only reference for MOD playing. A decent
   documentation on the exact specifics of MOD is not available yet, to my
   knowledge. All (I dare to say this) PC players, and probably those on all
   systems save the Amiga which benefits from MOD being designed around its
   hardware, play MODs wrong in some way or the other. The main two points to
   look for are accuracy and sound quality. Absolute accuracy isn't there yet,
   but there exist vast differences.
   BTW, even the format specs on MOD vary in a lot of cases. Don't believe any
   specification but the ProTracker one to be correct.

2) How do I calculate mod playback speeds

   This applies to MOD and S3M (and probably to most other module types).

   There are two playback speed settings in mods, one being the ticks-per-row
   (hereafter referred to as TPR) and the other the BPM (beats per minute)
   setting.

   The BPM statement denotes the amount of time that is to be spent on one
   tick. At default BPM speed of 125 decimal (7D hex), one tick equals to 0.02
   seconds. Thus, tick-time = (0.02 * 125 / BPM) seconds = (2.5 / BPM)
   seconds.

   The TPR speed groups a specified number of ticks into a row. Specifying a
   TPR speed of four groups four ticks into a row, for example.

   So, if you set a BPM speed of 150 and a TPR speed of 4, one tick will last
   for 1/60th of a second and four such ticks will be one row. Thus a row will
   last for 4/60ths of a second and a 64-row pattern will take 64/15 (=4.2667)
   seconds to play.

   MOD speeds are set using the Fxx command, where xx is a hexadecimal. Where
   xx ranges from 01 to 1F (in hex), TPR speed is set. F20 to FFF denotes BPM
   speed. A speed setting of zero should be ignored. The corresponding S3M
   commands are Axx (TPR speed) and Txx (BPM speed).
