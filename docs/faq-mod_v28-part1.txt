[1] General

This is the official FAQ for the UseNet Newsgroup alt.binaries.sounds.mods.
Should the date on this document be over a month old, you might want to check
for a current version.


Availability:

- It is posted to alt.binaries.sounds.mods, alt.answers and news.answers every
  two weeks, on Mondays. When this is not possible, the next possible day will
  be used.

- You can also obtain the most recent plain text version of the FAQ by
  Internet finger, dumping the answer to a file, as in: finger
  jester@fmr.maschinenbau.th-darmstadt.de > modfaq.txt . If your system fails
  to find my host, try specifying a specific host machine in my address, such
  as jester@chapel.fmr.maschinenbau.th-darmstadt.de instead (If chapel doesn't
  work, try sarek or sulu).

  You can also use a finger-by-mail server. Send the following message:
    Subject: FINGER jester@fmr.maschinenbau.th-darmstadt.de
    To: infobot@infomania.com
    Message Body: *none*
  and you will receive the latest plain text version of the FAQ in your
  mailbox. Of course, what I just said about conventional fingering applies
  here too, so if my address turns out unresolved try specifying a machine.

  Note that you will receive the complete FAQ (i.e. both parts), even if the
  header states otherwise. I have simply concatenated both text files.

[1.1] Motivation/Purpose of the FAQ

The newsgroup alt.binaries.sounds.mods (hereafter referred to as a.b.s.mods)
is being flooded by a lot of questions lately, most of them cropping up over
and over again. These, commonly referred to as Frequently Asked Questions
(hence the term FAQ, but you knew that already), are pretty bugging after a
while, so this is an attempt at answering them.

What is the purpose of this FAQ? Well, it is centered around a.b.s.mods, of
course, and deals with the problems that are usually encountered there. It is
supposed to help new readers of the group find programs and modules, decode
the posts, make contributions of their own and give pointers on where to find
further information. This FAQ does NOT attempt to teach you how to make music.
As of now, I am also not planning to devote sections of this FAQ to the
explanation of certain editors/trackers/players. Should a question concerning
a specific program come up very frequently, it would of course qualify as an
FAQ, but I do not consider it my job to teach you how to use ScreamTracker,
for example. That's the .DOC's job.

Keep in mind, please, that I manage this FAQ in my private time, which isn't
much anyway. I only know my own hardware platform (MS-DOS/Windows/GUS/SB), so
I am dependent on your feedback and contributions. If you have something you
feel belongs here or any other form of constructive criticism, don't hesitate
to email me with it (see 1.1.1). I check my mail folder almost every day,
except on weekends, when I don't have Internet access at all.

You can reach me at: jester@fmr.maschinenbau.th-darmstadt.de
(Note: I am NOT Jester/Sanity).

If you've contributed to the FAQ, your name and address (optional) will be
listed in the contributors section. You will also be entitled to a list of
your favourite mods and composers (might be dropped in the future if it
becomes too large).

Thank you.

[1.1.1] Submitting to the FAQ

As I already stated, the information included in this FAQ is believed to be
correct. If you happen to find errors, inaccuracies or out-of-date information
though, don't hesitate to inform me of it. The same applies to suggestions
you may have concerning additions or omissions.

When submitting to the FAQ, be sure to include all information that is
necessary. The easiest way for me is if you take the present FAQ as a
guideline. Pre-written and ready-to-use submissions are a lot less prone to
errors I could make in editing and summarising your information, helping both
of us.

Be sure to state which version of the FAQ and which section you are referring
to. I archive all versions since beta v0.7. Chances are that if you are
submitting to an old version of the FAQ, the information may already be there.
So if you think you have something to say, try to obtain the most recent
version before going to the trouble of writing a submission.

Expect me to ask you to give me more information than is in your submission.
So please supply me with a valid email address if my simply replying is not
reliable. If an email of mine containing further questions bounces, I will not
attempt to find you. I might try some other address specified in your email's
header, but don't count on it.

Suggestions implying complete rewrites of sections will be considered, but
you'll need some damn good reasons.

Thanks.

[1.2] Modules (What are mods?)

Modules are digital music files, made up of a set of samples (the instruments)
and sequencing information, telling a mod player when to play which sample on
which track at what pitch, optionally performing an effect like vibrato, for
example. Thus mods are different from pure sample files such as WAV or AU,
which contain no sequencing information, and MIDI files, which do not include
any custom samples/instruments. Mods are extremely popular in the demo world
and offer a way of making music of an acceptable level of quality rather
cheaply. With the advent of high-quality sound hardware, new generations of
mods may even rise to a sound quality nearing that of professional equipment.

Mods' sequencing information is based on patterns and tracks. A pattern is a
group of tracks with a certain length, usually 64 rows (see 1.3). The tracks
are independent of each other, meaning that a four track mod can play four
voices or notes simultaneously. The patterns can be sequenced in a playlist,
so that repeating the same sequence of patterns doesn't require rewriting of
them.

This makes mods a hybrid between pure sample data files such as WAV, VOC or
IFF/8SVX and pure sequencing information files like MIDI. One of the most
frequently asked questions is "how do I convert a WAV to MOD?". This can be
done, but is rather senseless.  The other way around might be interesting for
people with enormous hard drives, so they could listen to what used to be a
mod at higher quality than before at the cost of several megabytes of drive
space (10 MB/min. at 16 bits, 44.1kHz, stereo), or for those who want to show
off a mod to others who don't have a mod player (or worse, can only play 8kHz
AU files.. ;) ). SoundApp for the Mac, Multiplayer 2.0 for MS-DOS and the
upcoming Mod4Win 2.20 are programs that do this. For SoundApp and Mod4Win, see
the appropriate sections in this FAQ. The URL for Multiplayer is:

ftp://musie.phlab.missouri.edu:/pub/trs/tandy1000/sound/multip20.zip

It runs on any 286+ PC (not just Tandy).

Numerous mods have been released in the past year that were basically huge
samples off a CD (is there a connection to CD-ROM drives gaining increasing
popularity?), the only parts actually sequenced were the chorus bits. Most of
these mods were some form of top ten hit. These are, in effect, WAV to MOD
conversions. I don't mind them floating around, but it is a widely
acknowledged opinion that these kinds of mods defeat their own prupose. I
therefore don't recommend their making (but this is my opinion). Note that
this is NOT the same as using sampled drum loops or riffs in mods. While I
don't like these myself either, these do require a lot more sequencing than
huge 64KB chunks of a complete song.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1.3] Terminology used in this FAQ

- Throughout this FAQ, modules will be referred to as 'mods'. This term will
  be used for all types of modules, be they M.K., 8CHN, ULT, S3M, XM or
  anything else.
  IMPORTANT: Note that the term MOD (i.e. capitalized) refers to the group of
  mods that have this filename extension.

- A 'track' is a module voice. The number of tracks denotes the number of
  notes/instruments/voices that can play simultaneously.

- A 'pattern' is the largest sub-unit modules are composed of. Patterns are
  arranged in an order or sequencing list, so a pattern can be played several
  times within the same module. Patterns have a fixed length in most formats,
  but can also be of variable length in others. The standard M.K. pattern is 4
  tracks by 64 rows, for example.

- A 'row' is the smallest unit of time measurement in which notes can be
  placed on tracks. A M.K. pattern has 64 rows. OKT and FAR, for example, can
  have patterns of differing length in the same mod.

- A 'slot' is an element of a row, dedicated to hold a specific piece of
  information. These are notes, volume and effects, for example.

- A 'column' is an element of a track, such as the note column, the volume
  column and the effect column. A 'column' is a group of 'slots' of one type
  in a common track.

- A 'sample' is a digitized sound included in the mod, which serves as an
  instrument. As mods don't use a fixed instrument set (as General MIDI does),
  anything can be used as an instrument, including noises or human voices.

- A 'channel' is a source of emitted sound. Channel and track are often used
  interchangeably in the mod community. I'd prefer to define a channel as one
  of a few sound sources, as in stereo or quadro channels, but this would only
  prove confusing here.

- A 'player' is a program that decodes mods and ouputs these on a sound
  device.

- A 'tracker' is a program that enables creation of mods. Trackers usually
  feature a 'player'.

- A section saying 'NHY' isn't there yet (NHY = Not Here Yet). I don't have
  any information on the topic. If you do, get back to me immediately! (see
  1.1.1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1.4] Commonly Used Abbreviations (see section 2 for mod type abbrevs)

BPM - Beats per minute. When used in mods, this usually refers to how many
      groups of four rows are played per minute at default tempo (i.e. ticks
      per row) settings. This default tempo is 6 in MOD and S3M. Setting the
      tempo to 3 means that as many groups of eight rows are played per
      minute as set by the BPM set command.
CxSpd - Sampling rate at which a sample is reproduced by a tracker/player when
      it encounters the note C in octave x.
DAC - Digital to Analogue Converter. Digital sound output medium used with the
      parallel port of a computer.
DMA - Direct Memory Access (method of transferring data quickly across the
      computer's bus, DMA channel is a sound card parameter)
FM  - Frequency Modulation sound synthesis (used by Adlib and SB in FM mode)
FT1 - Mr.H/Triton's FastTracker 1.xx, MS-DOS MOD tracker
FT2 - Triton's FastTracker II
GUS - Gravis Ultrasound (sound card)
Hz  - Hertz, metric unit. 1 Hz = 1/sec. Used to express frequencies.
IRQ - Interrupt (not only, but also a sound card parameter)
PAS - Pro Audio Spectrum (sound card)
PT  - ProTracker (Amiga tracker)
SB  - SoundBlaster (sound card)
ST3 - PSI/Future Crew's Scream Tracker 3.2

[2] Types of Mods

This is a brief summary of mod types. For further information, see the
documentation of file formats and/or the associated trackers' documentation.
This is probably the best place to mention that the most common filetype
today on the Amiga is still MOD, while S3M and MTM have taken over on PC's. XM
is expected to gain popularity pretty quick.

In this list, Name refers to the identifier string found in modules of this
type or a term, which unambiguously identifies the module format type. The
Default Extension is the filename extension typically given to the mod type.
Note that, even though they are often used, extensions do not clearly define
formats. The No. of Tracks is pretty obviously the number of tracks mods
stored in this format can have. The No. of Samples states how many instrument
(sample) slots are available in the format. The Sample Properties denote the
no. of bits (i.e. the resolution) the format can store and wether the CxSpd is
fixed or variable. The Associated Tracker entry is only meant as an example.

       there yet to implement them.
**   - S3M can store 9 FM-based channels (Adlib).
***  - MTM supports these, but the current version of MMEdit doesn't allow for
       them.
**** - There are several versions of MED (MMD0, MMD1, MMD2 and MED). MED is
       the file format prior to OctaMED. All MEDs can be saved as so-called
       song files, i.e. w/o actual intrument sample data.

[3] Playing Mods

This section only features a maximum of 6 players per system. These are
selected mainly by popularity, but the amount of information I receive also
plays a big part. Players with special, unique and useful features may be
favoured (such as those which play rare file formats).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3.1] Amiga

This section supplied by Steven Innell <spi@dcs.qmw.ac.uk>, Christian Stieber
<stieber@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> and Heikki Kantola
<hkantola@cc.helsinki.fi>.

All of the following players can be found on aminet in mus/play/ (see 6.1).
All of the following players are proper applications, i.e. they use windows
and don't hack the hardware (except for the sound hardware). All of the
following players use external players to allow for an unlimited number of
formats (provided that somebody writes a player). All of the following players
support Pro/Noise/SoundTracker, ScreamTracker, FastTracker. I believe that
most of the players support MultiTracker and TakeTracker as well (DeliTracker
does).

- Delitracker V2.14
  As with Eagleplayer, a majority of the program has been re-written to speed
  it up, as well as adding several new players (Deli-AY being one), and
  improved S3M support. There are also a host of new "Genies", such as the
  Christmas Snow-Scene, and The Dr-Who genie. Fast Tracker II XM support has
  been added in version 2.14.
  This player is my personal favorite (editor's note: Steven Innell speaking),
  having a better gui, and nicer "feel". It too is a shareware production,
  costing around $20 (or 20 DM) again to register for. All features are
  available in the demo version.
  FTP: mus/play/Delitracker214.lha  (757K)

- EaglePlayer1.54c
  This player now has been re-written in areas, making it faster, and better
  looking. It also added several new "eagleplayers" which has increased the
  number of mod/music formats which it will play. It currently supports a
  majority of PC mod formats (S3M, MTM, FastTracker V1) and many Amiga style
  mods (too numerous to mention). You can also use some of the players from
  Delitracker, although some do not work, or are already included with the
  distribution archive.
  This is a Shareware production, and most features are available (except
  saving of configs, and mods) in the demo version. The registration fee is
  around $20.
  FTP: mus/play/Eagleplay1.54c.lha  (807K)

- D.A.S.ModulePlayer 3.5b
  Plays M.K., NST, 6CHN, 8CHN, MTM, S3M, Quadracomposer, MED, FutureComposer,
  SoundMon 2.0, FRED, MusicAssembler and David Whittaker mods. New formats may
  be added via external player libraries. Requires MUI for its GUI. Requires
  AmigaOS 2.0+. Crippled shareware 25 AUD, 70 FIM, $15.
  FTP: mus/play/DMODP35b.lha        (449K)

- PS3M V3.12
  V3.12 of this player is now the first player to support the PC Fasttracker2
  XM style mod. It also supports the other PC favorites (S3M - hence the name,
  MTM and Fasttracker V1), as well as the standard Amiga MOD format, and also
  PlaySid format, providing you have the playsid.library in your LIBS:
  directory.
  FTP: mus/play/PS3M312.lha         (32K)

- Hippoplayer V2.12
  This is the second player to support the FastTracker 2 XM mods. It is also
  one of the only players that will uncompress ZIPped files (as well as LHA -
  as do Eagle/Deli, and LZX'ed files) saving you the bother of having to do it
  8*). The sound quality from this player in most cases is IMO the best for
  the higher channel numbered PC mods (8-16 Ch in XM and S3M formats). It also
  supports the standard protracker format, and Playsid (providing you have the
  Playsid.library as with PS3M). In fact, the XM support was taken from PS3M,
  and so the player routines for the PC format mods are nigh on identical to
  those from PS3M, the difference being Hippo has a better front-end, making
  it nicer, and easier to use. Hippoplayer now incorporates directory opus
  Right Mouse Button selection boxes and external "Scopes" such as the PT-Note
  scope and various equalisers. Several enhancements and additions have been
  made to the program in this latest release.

[3.2] Atari

Thanks to Dan <cs93dlh@dcs.ex.ac.uk> for this information.

Note: To the best of Dan's knowledge, the programs mentioned here can be
    downloaded via ftp from atari.archive.umich.edu/pub/atari/ and its
    mirrors. A lot of them are also available from micros.hensa.ac.uk, but
    gopher of WWW access to this site is mich preferred to ftp as they have a
    weird directory structure.

Atari ST: This machine is very bad at playing MODs 'cause its sound basically
    isn't up to it. However, a player does exist. It is called Paula and is
    now at version 2.4. In order to run on the base ST you also need a driver
    called Petra, which is distributed with Paula. This will handle 4 track PT
    MOD format.

Atari STE/TT/Mega STE: These Ataris have massively improved sound abilities,
    roughly equivalent to the Amiga. You can use Paula (mentioned above) to
    playback 4-track PT MODs at a very respectable quality. Other 4 track
    players are DeskTracker and StarTracker.

Atari Falcon030: This latest of Atari's computers has a sound system as
    standard which blows away all but the most expensive of PC soundcards. It
    has 8-voice 16-bit stereo sound at 50kHz. This means it is very good at
    mod playback. It also has a Motorola 56001 DSP chip installed as standard
    - this chip can mix voices very fast, making 32 track mod playback
    possible at unbelievable quality.
    There are literally hundreds of 4-track MOD players out there, ranging
    from Paula through BSW, CPU_MOD and many more. There are fewer 8-track
    players and only one 32-track player. The best players for sound quality
    are:

    CPU_MOD - Handles 4-track PT MODs only, but gives the best sound quality
        I've heard. Will run in the background but is expensive on CPU time.

    BOBTracker - Handles 4, 6 or 8-track mods in a variety of mod formats (not
        S3M or MTM though). Sound playback uses the DSP for mixing and quality
        is good and very little CPU time is used. The DSP is also used to
        improve the sound quality of the samples in realtime and boost the
        bass and/or treble if desired

    MegaPlayer - Handles up to 32 tracks, virtually and mod format ever,
        including S3M and MTM. DSP is used for mixing, so little CPU time is

[3.3] Mac

See below (i.e. after the descriptions of the players) for solutions to the
"Mac and mod" FAQ par excellence, "how do you play S3M on a Mac".

For a description of Player Pro and Sound Tracker, the obviously most popular
Mac programs, see section 4.1.3

Rich "Akira" Pizor <pizor@lclark.edu> notes:

* The Macintosh-tracker. This freeware program plays MODs compatible with the
  Mar Epsie's Tracker, Player-Pro and the Sound-Tracker. It also features
  icons courtesy of Skaven and the Future Crew.

* Alpha-Tracker. This system extension is a tiny, faceless application that
  automatically plays randomly selected MODs in the background while you work.
  Slightly old, supports most 4-track formats.

* MusicBox XCMD. This XCMD for HyperCard adds a very functional MOD player to
  a HyperCard stack, allowing the more adventurous Mac owner to quickly and
  easily design their own MOD player. Supports most 4-track formats.

* Mod Player 1.3.1. Newly added to the info-mac archives, this program is
  designed to play mods with as small a footprint in the system memory heap as
  possible.  There are no bells and whistles, but this little gem is great for
  anyone running a low-end system.  Compatible with most mods that work with
  Sound-Trecker.

Lyman Green <lymang@uswsay.glaxo.com> adds on 21 Dec 1994:

* SoundApp 1.5.1 by Norman Franke will play or convert sound files dropped
  onto it. Currently, it supports: SoundCap, SoundEdit, AIFF, AIFF-C, System 7
  sound, Sun Audio AU, NeXT SND, Windows WAV, Creative VOC, Amiga MOD
  (including Oktalyzer, MED/OctaMED and some other variations with up to 32
  tracks), Amiga IFF/8SVX, Sound Designer II, DVI ADPCM, Studio Session
  Instruments and any 'snd' resource file. SoundApp can convert all of these
  formats to System 7 sound, sound suitcase, AIFF, WAV and NeXT formats.
  SoundApp can also convert QuickTime soundtracks and audio CD tracks to AIFF,
  System 7 sound or suitcase formats. Mod playback is PowerPC-accelerated on
  Power Macs.
  The following paragraph is from the SoundApp help file:
  Amiga MOD: This is not really a sound format but a music format. it stores
  digitized instruments and contains a musical score which produces a lengthy
  composition with a very small amount of data. There have been various
  extensions to this format, but SoundApp only supports those which Sound
  Trecker 2.2 supports. These include Amiga SoundTracker, StarTracker,
  NoiseTracker, ProTracker (4-track), Amiga StarTracker (4- and 8-track),
  Oktalyzer (4-8 track), Amiga MED/OctaMED (4-16 track MMD0/1/2 formats), IBM
  FastTracker (4-, 6- and 8-track), IBM TakeTracker (1-32 track). SoundApp
  does not support MTM or S3M formats. Native code will be used for MOD
  playback on a Power Macintosh.

Righto, here we go, "how DO you play S3M on a Mac?". What follows contributed
by Rich "Akira" Pizor on 22 Apr 95, updated 04 Feb 96:

Yes, S3Ms are the current standard for mods. No, there's not a lot of support
for them on the Mac. So, without getting into platform politics, here's what
you need to know.

As of this writing (2/4/96), your options are:

1) Use PlayerPro (see above). For those of you looking for a cheap way to
   download a free S3M player though, think again. PlayerPro only handles S3M
   files via import and until you pay the shareware fee, the import feature is
   disabled.

2) Mod Player Pro (can be downloaded from any info-mac mirror, same as all the
   other programs linked on this page) is supposedly a freeware program that
   will allow the playing of S3Ms directly upon download. The one time I tried
   it, it didn't work. Your milage may vary. If anyone is successful, I'd
   appreciate hearing about it; send mail to pizor@lclark.edu.

   ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/gst/snd/mod-player-pro-202b2.hqx

   NOTE: I'm not positive about the version number in the filename!

3) A program called MacMikMod (same URL as above; I don't know the exact
   filename, though) supposedly allows PowerMac users (sorry, it's native
   only, not fat binary) to play S3Ms for free. Not having a PowerMac, I can't
   verify the accuracy of this at all.

4) Find a friend with a different platform of computer, one that supports
   S3Ms. Give them the file you want. Have them save it in a format compatible
   with the player you prefer (Safest is M.K. or M!K!, but most Mac Players
   also support MED and a few other formats).
   (Note by jester: This is a way, *but* converting S3M to MOD will most
    definitely irrevocably lose you information, if it is at all possible, as
    S3M is a more advanced format than MOD.)

5) A handful of Mac models have an option for a DOS compatibility card,
   essentially putting a PC clone in the same box as your Mac and allowing you
   to start up in either OS. If you're a technonerd with bucks to spend, this
   may be an option.

MacModPro has been promising S3M support since version 3.0.1. As of 4.15, it
still doesn't support the format. Myself, I've given up hope.

A note about SoftWindows: For those of you with monster systems, $200 laying
around and 23 megs of disk space, you can get a DOS/Windows emulator called
SoftWindows. However, a machine slower than an 80 MHz PowerPC, trying to play
an S3M in a DOS or Windows program in SoftWindows will not be terribly
attractive to listen to. If you've got access to SoftWindows, you can take
advantage of S3M -> MOD conversion, but not much else.

  record the player's output to a WAV file. This player is exceptionally large
  in program size. Supports archives (ZIP, ARJ and RAR 2), has an integrated
  fancy file selector, echo/reverb and filter effects. Cubic is very popular
  nowadays. As of release version 1.6, only what was formerly called the
  'lite' version is released, i.e. the essential files are included, but only
  a few animation and background picture data files, if any. Version 1.7
  features INI files and gives you the chance to customize your background
  pictures. Freeware. By pascal / doj / ?hook.

- CapaMod 3.12
  CMOD plays MOD, S3M  and XM files. Gravis Ultrasound ONLY! Claims to be the
  most ProTracker-compliant MS-DOS player. S3M support has been added in
  version 2 and is pretty good by now (S8x and Xxx panning, mono/stereo
  detection), and Fast Tracker II XM is supported as of version 3. It now
  supports DMA transfer and a file selector capable of reading ZIPs. The
  selector can also read directories in ZIPs. A CapaPlay II unit for
  Assembler, C, Pascal and Basic is included for coders. By Heikki Ylinen

[3.5] OS/2

This section from David E. Wach <dave@gladstone.uoregon.edu> on 10 Nov 1994,
DMPlayer part updated by Doug White <dwhite@gladstone.uoregon.edu> 2 Sep 1995:

Digital Music Player 1.3 by Keith Murray <dodger@peak.org>:
Digital Music Player is a native, multithreaded OS/2 Presentation Manager
application that plays MODs, MIDs, WAVs, AVIs, and any other format that
MultiMedia Presentation Manager/2 (MMPM/2) supports. Supports any soundcard
that works with OS/2 (which is most). DMPlayer can play sounds at a maximum of
16-bit 44.1kHz stereo output. Output is placed in a buffer to keep the music
playing during high system activity, and contains priority management to
increase priority when the buffer drops below a specified point, and drop it
down when the buffer is increased. DMPlayer plays from a songlist, which
supports drag-n-drop and saveable songlists with a variety of sort and display
options. The songlist can contain any playable format, as well as archived
files. DMPlayer comes set up for gzip and zip files, but any archiver that can
extract files to standard output is supported.
DMPlayer's main screen looks like a CD player, with a songlist, buffer size,
current and total tracks, and song title. DMPlayer contains a sub-panel for
adjusting the volume, balance, bass and treble for drivers that support it.
An info panel displays the sample names/message, module format and source
filename.
DMPlayer supports 4 track, 31 and 15 instrument Protracker/Noisetracker
modules, 4 and 8 track Startrekker modules and 6 and 8 track Fasttracker
modules.
The shareware version can't save the settings or playlists, registration is
$25 and the key is sent back via EMail.
I've (editor's note: 1st person narrator is Doug White) used DMPlayer
extensively and, unfortunately, it isn't very tolerant of broken MODs,
archives or errors. It usually ends up locking and requiring a system reboot
to unfreeze. Hopefully these problems will be addressed in the next release.

ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/mmedia/dmplay13.zip

There is also ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/2_1/mmedia/tracker.zip which is
another .mod-only player, but it is rather buggy.  However it includes the
source code, so it might be of interest to hackers.

One last thing at hobbes.nmsu.edu in /os2/2_1/mmedia is pmixos2.zip which 
is a Pro-Audio Spectrum 16 mixer for os/2.  Don't know how good it is, i 
have a SB16!  

By the way, i was a little mis-leading.  I CAN run Mod4Win in a WinOS/2
session.  DMPlayer is the only NATIVE OS/2 mod player i know of.  The only
thing i have to do to Mod4Win to make it run with os/2 is to reduce its
number of buffers.  And I usually run it in a full-screen WinOS/2 session
(which makes some win apps. a little more stable).                       -dave

Eric Lowe <ericl@erinet.com> told me on 18 April 95:
DMP v4 (see section 3.4) runs correctly under OS/2. I use DMP32.EXE, though
DMP will run too, just not as well. The catch is that you can't run DMP32.EXE
from an icon directly, for some reason OS/2 doesn't recognize it as a valid
executable, so I created a dummy batch file DMP32S.BAT that I put in an icon
that just shells and runs DMP32. In fact, DMP32 runs better under OS/2 in a
VDM than the native Presentation-Manager DMPlayer and supports a heck of a lot
more formats.

[3.8] Apple II GS

special thanks to Ian Schmidt (IRSMan) <irsman@drift.winternet.com>, Kris
Olsen <olsenk@stolaf.edu> and Frank M. Lin (PoTTy) <fmlin@ccnet.com>.

The Apple IIGS is equipped with the Ensoniq 5503 chip, the 8-bit predecessor
to the GF-1 and 5506 chips found in modern PC soundcards like the Gravis
Ultrasound and Ensoniq Soundscape.


- MODZap v00.90b3 (115853 bytes): One of the best mod players available for
  the Apple IIGS. It boasts such features as a half screen oscilloscope, full
  screen oscilloscope (for people with a Zip Chip accelerator), and a
  4-Channel "QuadraScope". Also has option for a graphic-less display, good
  for multitasking. Arguably the best sounding mod player, supporting nearly
  all effects. By Ian Schmidt <irsman@drift.winternet.com>.

- NoiseTracker (522714 bytes): One of the more interesting mod players.
  Originally by Oliver Goguel and the FTA (Free Tools Association), 1WSW has
  released further "updates" (1.3, 1.4, 2.0). Many programmers have
  disassembled these so-called "updates" and have found little to no
  modification to the actual code, often changes actually harming sound
  quality.  Most people recommend sticking with v1.10.  This program runs
  under 8-bit mode, is written completely without tools, and therefore does
  not adhere to the Apple Human Interface. This program has a lot of Easter
  Eggs! By Oliver Goguel.

- ShellPlay v0.71 (23639 bytes): Approximately equal to MODZap in sound
  quality.  As the name implies, this player runs from any shell (like the
  Apple IIGS's UNIX flavor- Gno, or ORCA/M) and works well in the background
  (even with a high-speed modem connection). By Brian Bening.

- Sonobox (22141 bytes) : A new mod player based roughly on shellPlay, but

By no means is this a complete list; I did not include the NoiseTracker mod
player (the real NoiseTracker imports & converts mods into its own internal
format).

Also worth mentioning is SoundSmith. It's an excellent music program in which
you can write your own music pieces, but it only supports its own internal
format. It does have an incredible intro, and comes with some very good songs.
SoundSmith supports 14 tracks.

[4] Creating Mods

I consider it pretty normal for most people to tire of simply listening to the
tunes others have made after a while and to decide to use (perhaps waste) some
time in composing some of their own. This is where you need a tracker.

You might also want to convert this fabulous MIDI arrangement you downloaded
from someplace to a mod so you could muck around with it a bit, or simply to
be able to listen to it with digital instruments (if you're stuck with
SB/Adlib FM MIDI). You then need a converter and probably a tracker for
post-processing.

[4.1] Trackers

[4.1.1] Amiga

This section supplied by Steven Innell <spi@dcs.qmw.ac.uk> on Thu, 24 Nov 94,
updated/corrected by Sir Fitz <sirfitz@kaiwan.com> on Fri, 10 Feb 95:

- Protracker V3.15 ( / V3.10b - see the note below)

Probably the most used tracker until recently (with people using versions of
Octamed in preference). This tracker is the most up-to-date mod creator for
the amiga, based on the original Soundtracker interface (although highly
upgraded). This version was re-written by Cryptoburners, and has plenty of
editing options including simple sample manipulation (sampling, reverb,
reverse, cut/paste etc.), but, as of yet, does not have a midi option, nor
does it support any form of synthetic sound generation. It does however have
an option for using 14-bit samples, although these are few and far between.

It is a daunting program to use at first, especially if you have never had the
experience of using any tracker on the amiga (e.g. Soundtracker/Noisetracker/
Protracker V1-2.3), since this version uses the sample effect commands found
in those older version...and unlike the older versions, this does not have
on-line help listing the effects, and what they do.

Protracker is Freeware, with no form of registration/shareware fees to be
paid. A new version (3.20) was supposed to be out, but as of yet I have been
unable to find it. It can be found on Aminet under mus/edit/pt315.lha.

NOTE: On Wed, 17 May, Markus Weichselbaum contacted me (jester), saying
(excerpt):
"The last official version was PT3.10b, available on ftp.funet.fi. PT315 is an
 internal version never meant to be released (...). PT3.15 has been removed
 from Aminet, however there is a PT2.3 available. There are simply no '14-bit'
 samples released. The so-called 'DYN 14bit' system was working to some
 extent, but since the 'DYN' system was entirely rewritten, the development of
 PT315 was stopped. Only 2 or 3 test mods have been released, but no samples
 or documentation (...). I recommend use of PT310b which essentially has the
 same features as PT315. PT310 is indeed freeware, but PT3.15 is NOT."

When I (jester) asked Steven Innell about this, he replied (excerpt):
"I've had the program for 2 years. (...) I know U4IA, who once was a member of
 Cryptoburners, and also tested a lot of the original trackers out, and he has
 never said that PT3.15 was a leaked version never intended for release...in
 fact, a while back he told me they were working away on a commercial V4."

Finally, on 28 Sep 1995, Steven Innell mentioned the subject again, saying
(excerpt):
".. and I can now confirm that the release of most of the V3 series were not
 intended to be available as soon as they were (the exception being V3.00).
 However the programmer of V3.15 didn't seem to be worried (...) that PT was
 available, ... BTW, V3.10 is very unstable and unusable on accelerated
 machines but if you (or anyone else) feel that V3 should not be available,
 then the next best valid release that works is V2.3b AGA, which was fixed to
 run on AGA machines."

Now, all I (jester) have to say is that I don't mind anyone using whichever
version they wish and I hope the above, especially the last note, clears up
any confusion that may have been created.


- OctaMed (V6)

This is the latest version of this series of Trackers by Teijo Kinnuen.
Several changes have been made to the program, the first and most notable
being that OctaMed now opens its screen on the WorkBench screen, using
whatever ScreenMode was being used by the WB. Amongst the many features added
are better/or new SoundCard support (Aura/Tocatta) improved 8 channel
handling, completely new interface (as mentioned above - sortof)

The New features are numerous, and if you are a med fan, you are advised to
Download the demo of Version 6 from Aminet, and read the large documentation
that comes with it. Note that OctaMed is a Commercial Program, and can be

(FAQ editor's note: the rest of the OctaMed description is retained from the
 former entry concerning V5, as it offers more details)
This tracker started way back as a clone of Soundtracker 2.5, and was called
MEDV1.13. It grew and changed till V3 became the basis of octamed (an
8-channel tracker). Med all versions up to OctaMed V4.00g are freeware.

This program (V5) is now fully protracker compatible, in that it now imports
protracker modules, and will play them at the correct speed. It also has the
option for using some of protrackers shortcut keyboard commands. This version
of Octamed also now has a vastly improved front end. It opens its own window
on the Workbench, and uses proper intuition gadgets/menus. It is very easy to
work around, and comes with on-line amigaguide help. (There is also the manual
on disk - as a guide if you wish to look up something). Octamed allows for the
creation of synthetic sounds via its own special editor, which may take a
while to get used to. It also has good sampling capabilities and editing of
samples. This program also allows for the use of midi equipment, providing
16-channels of midi on to of the 4/8 amiga channels. However, be
warned...using 8 channels slows the machine, and reduces sample quality..it is
not advised. There is a High Quality mode which tries to increase the quality
of samples when played in 8 ch mode, but it requires a 68020 or higher to be
in your machine (030 really at least).

Octamed also has the ability to vary the length of patterns up to a maximum of
999 rows/pattern. This allows for better structuring of the way you create
your tune, so whereas before you may have had to shove a patternbreak in a few
rows before the end of the pattern, now you can just increase the length of
the pattern et voila!.

Octamed has a variety of ways of saving the tunes you create in it. It can
save as its format (MMD2), Octamed2-4 (MMD1) or Protracker. You can also use
compression, the two modes being offered are LH (requires Lh.library) or
Powerpacker (requires Powerpacker.library v35 at least). You can save
with/without instruments, although you'll probably end up saving as a tracker
mod, as this is more widely playable on other formats....be warned
however...protracker doesnt support some of the commands available in Octamed
(8 ch mode - midi - extended/shortened patterns - synthetic sounds) so if they
are used, they will not appear in the tracker version, and so the mod will not
sound/behave as you may have expected.

A freely distributable version of Octamed can be found on Aminet under:

Octa5.lha     mus/edit  618K   - demo of V5
OctaMedv4.lha mus/edit  299K   - Music editing software, 8 voices


- Noise/Soundtrackers - see above on protracker, as these are all alike except
v2.6 of soundtracker..which used a different approach to making the mods.


- StarTrekker (Vers unknown sorry ;-)

This is a mod editor in the same vain as Octamed. It has a layout the same as
the old sound/noisetrackers, but also has the ability to use 8
channels...hoever 8 channel mode sounds really bad, and you are better off
using octamed, or protracker.

Availability of the above: almost nill....some PD houses may still stock them


- FTM (Face The Music)

This is an 8 channel mod editor. The mods it produces are usually of very good
quality (even on a straight A500), although the program itself is very fiddly
to use. I cannot say much about this program as I havent really used it much
at all. There is a demo of it on Aminet though, under:

FTM_Demo.lha  biz/demo   381K

It is a shareware demo...and I cant remember the Reg. fee...sorry =8*)


- Future Composer V1.3/4

This is a wholly synthetic mod editor (saying that..it does allow the use of
samples). It does not import/export tracker mods though. This program is very
old (1989 ish) and is very fiddly to use..even with the manual printed out and
In front of me. The tunes this "tracker" generates sound a lot like the 8-bit
machines tunes (eg C64 music).  Some of the tunes are however very nice
sounding, its just a shame the program is so damn hard to use ;-)

Availability: almost nill...some PD houses may have them...but apart from that
I cant say where they can be obtained... They are freeware though.


- Art Of Noise

This is a recent mod Editor for the Amiga. It is a shareware demo of the
program, the full version costing 79 DM (available only from the author).

First of all, it is 100% protracker compatible (load-format !) That means,
that you don't have to get used to new shortcuts to old (protracker) functions
! But that doesn't mean, that this tracker is just another protracker clone!
You might already have noticed, that AON has got dozens of new functions. If
you load AON for the first time, you might be slayed by all these new
functions, but it's worth taking a look at them. I think it would be the best
to list up a few of them:

  + OS-2 graphical environment !  Reqtools-Requester !
  + Supports euro-72 monitors !!
  + 8 channels! But in contrary to startrekker/octamed/oktalyzer this time
    REAL 8 channels, that means free volume/pitch-settings on EVERY channel,
    loops ofcourse also possible (achieved by real-time Mixing of channels)
  + maximal number of instruments increased to 61 !
  + maximal number of patterns increased to 128 !
  + maximal number of positions increased to 256, including restartposition !!
  + wavetable & sampleinstruments.
  + 'macro' instruments possible: E.g. 10 instruments can share the same
    waveform, but the samplestart (for example, there is certainly a greater
    number of possibilities offered by this feature!) can vary from instrument
    to instrument ! Wavetable instruments can be used to create 64er-like
    sounds, but they are also great for big resonance-pads etc. !!
  + number of player-commands increased from 28 (protracker) to 45 ! And there
    are ofcourse a lot to come in future versions !
  + Supports powerpacker and STONECRACKER (the best cruncher around!)
  + Arpeggio (maximal 7 notes!) + any other effect, arpeggio speed changeable
  + Remark (normal textfile/ansi) linkable to module !!
  + FM-Synthesis !
  + Drumsequencer! Make your own drumlines with up to 16 tracks !!
  + Big sampleeditor ! Features samples>128k, multisampling, sample-trigger
    digital-filter with selectable depth, flanger, phase-distortion, direct
    'freestyle' sampleediting: paint your own waves !
  + supports external-synchronizing, e.g. for demos or other presentations!
  + Player is easy to build in in own programs.
  + Turbo-Player available, takes about 1-2 rasterlines (faster than any other
    player!)
  + Update service for future versions!

The whole handling has been changed ofcourse, so just check out the preview !
If you like this program, please don't copy it. A program worth using is a
program worth buying ! Contact me at the following address:

or call: 04298-30731 or 04298-4873 (16h-22h) (if other line is busy or nobody
picks up)

The full-version will cost 79DM and features a very nice printed manual plus 4
disks (program/workshop/instruments/demomods) !

The preview version lacks of save-routines, but all effects and functions are
useable!

[4.1.2] Atari ST

Thanks to Dan <cs93dlh@dcs.ex.ac.uk> for this information.

Note: To the best of Dan's knowledge, the programs mentioned here can be
    downloaded via ftp from atari.archive.umich.edu/pub/atari/ and its
    mirrors. A lot of them are also available from micros.hensa.ac.uk, but
    gopher or WWW access to this site is much preferred to ftp as they have a
    weird directory structure.

Atari ST: There is a port of ProTracker from the Amiga. This will allow you to
    create 4-track MODs.

Atari STE/TT/Mega STE: To create mods on these machines, you basically have a
    choice of two programs - ProtrackerSTE or Octalyser

    ProtrackerSTE is an upgraded port of ProTracker from the Amiga. It handles
    only 4 tracks, but has the full PT command set and gives good quality
    playback. (Note there are also a bundle of PT clones for these machines,
    such as Esion)

    Octalyser is an 8-track tracker. You need a fast STE or a TT to playback
    all 8 tracks though. Octalyser will let you create or play back 4, 6 or 8
    track mods. It will load many different mod formats, but not S3M or MTM.
    Sound quality is quite good.

Atari Falcon030: For creating mods on this machine, there are basically three
    main choices:

    Octalyser (mentioned above) has drivers for the enhanced sound system,
    thus giving good quality playback, but only 4, 6 and 8 track mod formats,
    not S3M or MTM.

    MegaTracker - 32 track tracker. All tracker commands and practically all
        mod formats are supported including S3M and MTM. Unbelievable speed
        and quality are produced by the DSP mixing. Unfortunately, the
        instructions have not yet been translated from french, but it is only
        a matter of time.

    Digital Tracker - 32 track tracker. Supports almost all tracker commands
        and formats, although it hangs on some S3Ms. this is commercial
        software and only a demo is available, which has certain restrictions.

[4.1.3] Mac

This section by Barry Nathan <barryn@netcom.com> and Rich "Akira" Pizor
<pizor@lclark.edu>. Barry writes on Thu, 17 Nov 1994:

The programs mentioned here are available from:
info-mac: ftp://ftp.sumex-aim.stanford.edu/pub/info-mac/
umich: ftp://mac.archives.umich.edu/pub/

However, sumex (info-mac) itself is hardly accessible, and one of its mirrors
(like ftp://ftp.hawaii.edu://mirrors/info-mac/snd/util) will be better.

Player Pro 4.5: Can access the sound chip directly, so it takes less processor
time than SoundTrecker. It'll still work when new Macs with new sound chips
come out, because it can also use the regular Sound Manager 3.0 if necessary,
like when the PowerMacs came out and Player Pro didn't support their sound
chip. Only edits its own format, MADF, but it can import and export MOD, S3M,
MIDI, XM, 669, OKTA and MED (as of version 4.5 the S3M import filter is out of
beta stage). Version 4.5 also supports multiple samples in one instrument.
PlayerPro has a very mixed track record for some of its more obscure import
and tracking options, but reportedly plays many of the basic mod formats
better than the other Mac heavyweight, Sound-Trecker 2.2. PlayerPro is
shareware and until you pay the $20 registration fee, most tracking/editing
features are turned off (including import and save) and it will automatically
quit after having been open for 20 minutes.  A CD-ROM version is also
available for $40, which comes with a library of mods and instrument samples.
Upgrades are free, except for the upgrade from the disk to the CD-ROM version,
which will cost $20 for an upgrade. Unlike Sound-Trecker, it is fully
PowerMac-native, which means it FLIES by on a PowerMac.

Sound-Trecker: $40 shareware. Partially, but not fully, PMac native, but 
it can do simulated surround sound for headphones or (I think...) Dolby 
Surround decoders. However, with the Surround option, the fact that it's 
not fully native really shows, as you hear clicks when you try to do 
other stuff. However, the slowdown isn't that severe on normal Macs. The 
two other advantages are that it can play (Okta)MEDs, which Player Pro 
can't handle, and some MODs play better with it than Player Pro. Keep in 
mind that with the extra features and bug fixes with Player Pro 4.2, most 
MODs play -much- better with Player Pro, though, and PP is cheaper.

Rich "Akira" Pizor adds: Sound-Tracker is a shell program which plays formats
based on plug-ins, providing for maximum flexibility, since plug-ins can
easily be written whenever a new format is introduced. Currently, most of the
standard 4- and 8-track MOD formats are supported. Also available is a plug-in
that makes it PowerPC native. It is also known for having one of the better
interfaces of Mac MOD players. The resoucres for creating/editing MODs are
present, yet the appropriate menu items are geryed out. I've not met anyone
who could explain this anomaly to me. The two theories I've heard are that you
get editing capabilities if you register the program (German ReadMe not too
well understood) or that the resources are simply sitting there while the
author learns how to integrate the corresponding features into a later release
of the program.

MacMod Pro is now in version 4.15 and has received a MAJOR overhaul. The staff
editor works and it works pretty well, though it takes a little getting used
to. One nice feature is the ability to record in realtime from the soft
keyboard, a feature which isn't (to the best of my [editor's note: this is
Akira's] knowledge) supported by any other Mac tracker. It supports anywhere
from 4-32 channels and up to 39 instruments. It also allows you to set
preferences linking it to specific directories for various files, so when you
try to load a new instrument or mod or file, it goes straight to the
appropriate directory, rather than having the user navigate to the right
place. S3M support has been promised since version 3.0.1, but the format is
unsupported as of version 4.15.
[FAQ maintainer's / editor's notes: There is no confirmed information about
 MacMod Pro's native file format yet (I suppose Akira simply forgot to mention
 it). I also *assume* the program marketing status hasn't changed, so here's
 the information from the last FAQ revision:]
MacMod Pro is shareware.  A $25 registration fee is required to unlock the
Save option, but all other functions work off the shelf, so you can get a good
feel for how the program works and for what it takes to make a mod.

ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/info-mac/snd/util/mac-mod-pro-322.hqx
[Note: This URL is, of course, WRONG! I need to get Akira to tell me the right
 one. Or I could go look for it myself.... Anyhow, just cd to the directory
 and you should be able to find the file.]

Meditor, a freeware Mac tracker, is currently on version 0.63delta. It supports
all
the mod formats supported by Sound Trekker, as well as its own format that can
be played only through Meditor and Sound Trekker and through the latter only
viy a plug-in module provided with Meditor. There is no PC support for this
file that I know of ('bout time we had one that PC-people didnt! ;).
Version 0.63, the latest release, has become a LOT more stable...you can still
only have one document open at a time, but at least it doesn't spontaneously
crash any more...well, at least as much. :)  Still only a classical editor,
but still free.
Meditor can be downloaded from any info-mac mirror.  Don't ask me why, but
they put it in the /gst/snd/midi directory.  Don't let this fool you --
MEDITOR IS NOT A MIDI SEQUENCER!  The info-mac moderators just screwed up; hey
they're only human.

[4.1.4] MS-DOS

MS-DOS users have quite a few trackers available to them nowadays, with
capabilities superior to first-generation mods. Beta releases and unpopular
trackers are not mentioned, the ones listed should suffice to get you started.
That'd include:

- Scream Tracker 3.21 - programmed by PSI of Future Crew. Supports GUS, SB, SB
    Pro. Edits up to 32 digital tracks (but plays only up to 16), 99
    instruments (S3M format supports 255), features a superset of the
    ProTracker command set (but some effects are handled a little different),
    8 bit samples with adjustable C4Spd (S3M format allows for 16 bit ADPCM
    packed stereo samples), 9 Adlib FM channels (only playable on SB or SB
    Pro) and 8 octaves. Features separate volume column (and track panning
    available in most players). Extensive block commands and editing
    capabilities make this one of the best trackers around nowadays. Version
    3.2 is extensively bugfixed over the previous release. Writes in S3M and
    MOD formats (but S3M to MOD conversion is NOT recommended!). Reads S3M,
    STM (perfect), M.K., 6CHN, 8CHN, Oktalyzer MOD, 5 to 10 track MOD (pretty
    good MOD loader) and a proprietary import format. Has an own sample
    format, which it shares with Advanced Digiplayer, but ST3 can also read
    raw 8-bit samples (signed and unsigned). MOD samples (signed 8-bit) can be
    imported by loading a MOD that uses them into ST3 (all information is
    retained). Freeware.

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/s3m/scrmt321.zip

- FastTracker II - programmed by Mr H and Vogue of Triton. Supports GUS, SB
    and SB Pro. Edits up to 32 tracks, 128 instruments, multi-sampled
    intruments (up to 16 samples per instrument), volume and panning envelopes
    for instruments, instrument panning, 4 GB maximum sample size,
    bidirectional looping, variable pattern length, built-in sample editor,
    sampler and CD dumper, 256 patterns, separate volume/panning/vibrato
    column, claims full MIDI support. Imports MOD, STM, S3M type mods, GUS
    patches, raw samples (signed and unsigned) and IFF samples. Samples can be
    8 or 16 bits. Sample tuning by finetune and relative note value.
    Shareware $20.

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/ft206.zip

    There exists the Fast Tracker II Resource Web Page, offering guidance on
    getting started with FastTracker, obtaining it, help on keyboard commands,
    effects, sample sources and links to other pages at:

    http://huizen.dds.nl/~freeze/

- Impulse Tracker 2.02 - programmed by Pulse (Jeffrey Lim). Supports SB16,
    GUS, SB Pro, SB and PC Speaker. Features a Scream-Tracker-3'ish interface.
    Edits up to 64 tracks, 99 instruments, multi-sampled instruments, volume,
    panning and pitch envelopes, bidirectional looping, 8/16 bit samples with
    variable C5Spd (higher tuning range than ST3). Uses a (slightly altered)
    superset of the S3M commands. Boasts the so-called New Note Actions.
    Imports S3M, MTM, MOD and IT type mods, ST3 and IT type samples /
    instruments (anything else is interpreted as raw data). Mod files can be
    used as instrument libraries. Writes IT and S3M files (S3M with
    restrictions). Non-crippled non-obliging shareware.

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/it202.zip

    Impulse Tracker also has three Web sites; the American, Australian and
    European HQs are at:

    http://www.citenet.net/noise/it
    http://cuburbia.bns.com.au/pages/clients/impulse.html
    http://huizen.dds.nl/~im-pulse

- MultiTracker Module Editor 1.01b - programmed by Daniel Goldstein aka
    Starscream of Renaissance. Supports GUS, SB and SB Pro. Edits up to 32
    tracks, 31 instruments, features the PT command set (which is not
    completely compatible), 8 bit samples (MTM format can store 16 bits).
    Features track panning. Imports raw samples and GUS patches (only
    registered). Loads MOD, 669, MTM and FAR mods, more formats planned. Right
    now, loading anything but MTM is not recommended (FAR and 669 sound bad).
    Shareware $24.95

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/mtm101b.zip

- Farandole Composer 1.00 - programmed by Daniel Potter of Digital Infinity.
    Supports GUS only. Edits 16 tracks, 64 instruments, an own command set
    (does not claim to be PT-compliant), 8 and 16 bit sample support, sample
    size up to 1 Meg, imports MOD, 669, GUD PAT and ST3/Digiplayer samples.
    Features separate volume column and track panning. Loads MOD, 669, ULT
    (buggy) mods. Uses SVGA to display all tracks on screen simultaneously in
    132x50 mode. Has a built-in sample editor. Shareware $15. The FAR format
    is not very well supported (outside this tracker).

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/far100.arj

- UltraTracker v1.6 - programmed by MAS of Prophecy. Supports GUS. Edits up to
    32 tracks, 8 and 16 bit instruments, variable C2Spd with finetune,
    bidirectional looping, instrument panning, 255 patterns, subset of the PT
    commands, two effect slots per note. Built-in sample editor. Imports S3M,
    MOD, 669, FAR and MTM mods. Imports IFF, PAT, WAV, FSM, SND and raw sample
    types. Mouse driven. Shareware $20. The ULT format is not very well
    supported (outside this tracker).

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/ultra160.zip

- FastTracker 1 - programmed by Mr H of Triton. Supports SB, SB Pro,
    Soundplayer, DAC, Internal Speaker. Edits 4, 6 or 8 tracks, 31
    instruments, 8-bit samples of 64KB maximum size, ProTracker command set,
    track panning supported by external players, 100 patterns. Relatively
    simple, easy to use tracker, which is good for starters, but it suffers
    from its output formats' deficiencies. Partly mouse driven. Freeware.

    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/programs/trackers/ftracker.zip

- ModEdit (current version reported to be v3.01) - programmed by Norman Lin.
    Supports SB, DAC and the internal speaker using Mark J. Cox's playing
    routine (it runs even on 286 PC's). Edits only M.K. format. Mouse-driven
    menu interface. This editor's main quality is its sort-of-musical
    notation. Whereas almost all other trackers display the tracks vertically
    and notes are only discernible by their key character, ModEdit displays
    the current pattern horizontally and the notes on a vertical spread. This
    editor is old but could suit some people to get started on. It has a very
    good documentation, which can unfortunately be a bit misleading at times,
    however. Shareware $??

Thanks to Andreas Schiffler <andreas@karlsberg.usask.ca> for this information.

With the new version of DOSEMU (ver. 0.60.4), quite a number of trackers work
under Linux. As of this version, DOSEMU supports Soundblaster emulation and
basic DMA, which should get most trackers working with it. It is available at

  The features of this seemingly only Windows tracker are unknown to me, as I
  couldn't maintain a link to the ftp site. All I know is that it's coded by
  Captain Apathy <75713.2012@compusrv.com> for PlayItSoLoudItHz Productions
  and that the URL is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4.2] Converters

Conversion between mod formats and especially conversion from/to non-mod music
file formats is pretty sure to lose some information of the original piece.
In most of the cases, there is no way around this. You can't, for example,
convert a 16-track S3M using Qxy and excessive volume commands to a 4-track
M.K.. The M.K. just can't hold the information. It is possible, on the other
hand, to convert a M.K. to S3M very accurately. There are a few minor
incompatibilities, but these would hardly be noticeable by many.
Conversions to and from MIDI are also very difficult to get done right with
today's mod formats. MIDI files, while seemingly similar, have a very
different command set from mods. Only one of the differences is that the MIDI
output device 'knows' how to process its sounds when it receives commands from
the MIDI file/player, for example how fast to decay a piano waveform. This
information is not stored in the MIDI file itself, but a mod would have it
included. A converter has no means of asking the MIDI device how it would
handle a certain situation (this is not completely correct, at least when
using a GUS, the patches could be parsed), so it has to assume certain things.
I suppose, however, that better converters could do the trick if they were
programmed for certain situations (I think a converter that creates mod
instruments by itself from a GUS' patches, for example, could accurately
convert from MIDI to an advanced mod format such as S3M, XM or ULT).
But did you want to know any of this?

[4.2.1] from MIDI

- PTMID 0.3  - converts General MIDI files to MOD (i.e. M.K., 6CHN and 8CHN)
  and MTM files. To do this, it relies on a configuration file which specifies
  the samples to be used, the number of tracks to generate and the resolution
  to use. A careful setup is therefore absolutely necessary if anything good
  is going to emerge. The resulting mods will generally still require some
  re-editing in a mod editor. Seems like it's freeware.

Amiga (this subsection supplied by Heikki Kantola <hkantola@cc.helsinki.fi>):

There's several "exotic" mod formats for Amiga which are usually just
differently packed ProTracker variants and therefore pretty easy to convert to
normal PT format. There are at least the following mod converters on Aminet
(see section 6.1; unless a path is given, the files mentioned below reside in
mus/misc/):

- Perverter-V1.41.lha - Converts exotic mods to MOD

- Pro-Wizard.lha - Convert many music formats to PT

- xmodule26b.lha - Music module converter v2.6b

And then also a bit weirder ones:

- mus/edit/smus2mod.lha - Convert SMUS music files to MOD files

- mus/midi/Mod2Midi10.lha - Convert MODs to General MIDI type 1 files


MS-DOS:

- Mtm2S3m 0.91a - converts MTM to S3M modules. Doesn't convert samples >64K
  yet, but this is planned for the future. By Zab/DA

- M2AMF - supplied with DMP (see MS-DOS players), this generates an AMF file
  from all file formats understood by DMP. AMF files are generally smaller
  than the corresponding MOD files. However, DMP is the ONLY player for these
  files and conversion of AMF to other formats isn't possible yet, so it's a
  one-way street. And we all know that DMP, versatile as it may be, doesn't
  play anything (except AMF) right. By Otto Chrons.

- ScreamTracker 3.21 contains the option to save mods as M.K., 6CHN, 8CHN, S3M.
  MOD output is, however, slightly inaccurate, since S3M commands are not
  fully ProTracker-compliant. Another deficiency arises from the variable
  C4Spd available in S3M. ST3 tries to finetune the samples, but doesn't
  perform any resampling or note adjustments. This means that an instrument
  with a C4Spd of above 8795Hz or below 7902Hz (or integer multiples of these)
  will sound off tune if the note isn't adjusted in the resulting MOD. By
  PSI/FC.
